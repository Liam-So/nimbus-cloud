## Nimbus Cloud

Fullstack application that leverages AWS services, and the Spotify API to send a user a brand new song of the day based on the seed genres they selected upon registration.

Note- Due to the provision service charges on AWS, the application is non-functional when running it locally. Instructions to run it locally will be provided nonetheless.
